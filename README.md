# Weather-App
This is a front-end AngularJS app for check weather by zip code or city name, completed as a code challenge for Emogi.

Available live here: https://hongbinc.github.io/Weather-App 

`(Due to a Yahoo weather API bug, if the website load slowly, please wait 3-5 seconds or refresh the page)`

Currently still a work in progress. As I make continued improvements, I'll update this README.
